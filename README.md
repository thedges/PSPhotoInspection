THIS SOFTWARE IS COVERED BY [THIS DISCLAIMER](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/thedges/Disclaimer/master/disclaimer.txt).

This package contains a Lightning component for performing photo-based inspections. Currently you need to setup as a Quick Action on a record and use from standard Salesforce Mobile app. It was developed as a Lightning Web Component so hopefully can utilize in Field Service Lightning at some point in future when they allow LWC extensions.
